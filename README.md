A study guide for course prework

# Bootcamp Study Guide

## Description

A website providing notes on topics covered in the bootcamp prework. I built this project to help quickly reference what I had previousily learned, also to help cement certain concepts by having a easy to read single page webpage. Building this project provided me with the knowlede to structure a basic webpage with HTML, add styles and effects with CSS and to undterstand the basic logig of JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Simply scroll down the webpage to view each topic covered in the prework including HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub and JavaScript.
If you hover over a topic card, there is a basic colour effect just for fun!
If you head in to the browser console, JavaScript will even decide on a random topic for you to study.
