            If you set display to flex, all children inside of the container
            become a flex item. They will be automatically arranged into a row
            and each element will be the same width as their content. The flex
            container spans its own width, and each child has to fit in the
            container's width.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you set display to inline-flex, it makes the flex container
            behave like an inline element.
          </li>
          <li>
            flex-direction can change the direction from horizontal or vertical
            with 'row' & 'column'.

            The <em>git push</em> command is used to upload local repository
            content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits
            from your local repository to a remote repo.
