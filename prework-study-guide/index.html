            If you set display to flex, all children inside of the container
            become a flex item. They will be automatically arranged into a row
            and each element will be the same width as their content. The flex
            container spans its own width, and each child has to fit in the
            container's width.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you set display to inline-flex, it makes the flex container
            behave like an inline element.
          </li>
          <li>
            flex-direction can change the direction from horizontal or vertical
            with 'row' & 'column'.
          </li>
          <li>
            To adjust the sizing of flex items, you will use the three values
            that come along to the flex property:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>grow -></strong> This will determine how elements will
              expand to fill in extra space (if any) in the flex-container.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>shrink -></strong> This will determine how elements shrink
              when there isn't enough space in the flex-container.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>basis -></strong> will set the initial size of the
              flex-items.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="smallText">

            The <strong>git push</strong> command is used to upload local
            repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you
